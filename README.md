- 👋 Hi, I’m @FabLabScience
- 👀 I’m interested in fab science/technology/engineering/arts/maths (STEAM) projects that help engage people of all ages into this fascinating world. I'm particularly interested in projects related to acoustics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning real time data acquisition on Pi/Arduino platforms and signal analysis in python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above.
- 📫 How to reach me - coming soon.
